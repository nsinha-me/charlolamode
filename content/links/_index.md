Title: Links
type: list

Here’s a page where I give credit to people. I’ve also included links to other websites that I find useful or interesting. Since search engines tend to only rank the most popular sites with few exceptions, finding interesting small websites is increasingly difficult. Obviously, linking a website here does not constitute an endorsement of everything they’ve ever posted.

### [BugsWriter](https://bugswriter.com) (Suraj Kushwah)
Bugs is cool dude. I started watching his YT videos in Jan-2021, and he made me fell in love with linux. He showed the power of terminal. He inspired me to have personal website and mail. Earlier I was dual booting, but he showed some of the fancy tools along with the power of awk, sed, grep, cut commands that made me finally switch to linux permanently.  
Also, my personal website contains some of the contents copied from his website.


### [Eric Murphy](https://ericmurphy.xyz/)
Eric makes some of the best linux videos in my opinion. His videos are to the point and very well explained. Eric is so calm and I like his voice too.  
Also, my personal website contains some of the contents copied from his website.


### [Denshi](https://denshi.org/) (Alex)
Denshi is cute guy who also has YT video on Gentoo installation, its so rare. Also his website is simple and cool.
