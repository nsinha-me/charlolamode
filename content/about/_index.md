## Hello Friend üëã

Since you have come here to know more about me, let me introduce myself.

- My name is Nikhil Sinha. [^2]

- Currently looking for a job in tech industry.

- I‚Äôm a [GNU/Linux](https://www.linux.org/) user, mainly [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/). [^3] I no longer use or need Microsoft¬Æ Windows¬Æ or Apple¬Æ macOS¬Æ.

- I love operating systems and like to automate the boring things using small scripts.

- Apart from programming/linux I like knowing random stuff that interests me (especially biology and evolution), trying new things, making things.

- I love to read [Rashmirathi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashmirathi) by Ramdhari Singh Dinkar and sometimes listen to the mushaira's of [Jaun Eliya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaun_Elia)  [^4] (also spelled as Jaun Elia).

- Recently I have fallen in the trap of [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/). Amazed by the wonders it can do.

[^1]: This website went live on 07-Feb-2023 with the sole purpose of having an online identity that is free from the dictatorship of *Big Corporate Giants* namely Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Twitter. I really hate the control and censorship they have over us. Atleast as a user, I should have the freedom of what I want to see, what I want to post. **But no**. They want to show me what their algorithm thinks is good for me. They want my eyeballs to be fixed on their sucking app so that they can show me as many ads as possible. Take for example Instagram, why can't it show only the posts from accounts I follow on its homepage. But noooo. It will show memes and cringe content on its homepage. I don't want to see memes at all because I don't find it funny. I just want to see posts from my friends and family. 
Leave it. These giants will not change their mind. Because their main focus is money and not the end users. Does it mean that I will not use any of the products of these giants? No. I will still be using their product, but slowly and gradually I will be shifting to more freedom respecting products/services. This website is the first step in this direction. Also, my mail. I own it. I can change my mail server provider anytime I want. I don't want to be on the mercy of gmail.


[^2]: In India it is pretty much common to be called by their last name. So many of my friends and teachers call me Sinha or Mr. Sinha.


[^3]: I don't use Arch because I want to look cool on forums by saying '*I use arch, btw.*' and post my rice on [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/). I use Arch because of AUR and the latest packages it has (btw, rapid Flatpak and Flathub growth is great imo). Also, I consider myself to be newbie in Linux world. I have lot to learn. Btw, I use arch. üòÇüòÇ.
