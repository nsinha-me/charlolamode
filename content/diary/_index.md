Hi, I am Nikhil Sinha. I was born on 14-Jan-1999.  
Date of starting this diary : 03-Mar-2023.  

What you are reading is my entire life's journey. I am writing all this as a proof of my existence. My emotions, my feelings, my views, my ideas and my experiences. Existence needs witness, reality is related to mind. This is why, I want you to know - I existed. I was sad at this day, I was happy on that day. Anyone around the world can be aware of my existence, even after I die. Yes ofc, one day I will sure die, not sure when. Day by day people will forget me. But thanks to internet even 100 years after my death, someone can look into my existence. Someone, just like me.

### # 25-Mar-2023 Saturday
_dadi_(grandmother) came to meet us. Wished _akash_ birthday. Asked him about colleges. Talked to _pradeep_. I am happy with his decision. I am happy that I have friends like _pradeep_ who are not coward. I don't know what will be its outcome, but the decision that _pradeep_ took are the decisions taken by brave people. Happy and proud.  
At night went to _assi ghat_ with _prateek_. Talked to foreigners for 1 hour. They were from _Germany_. They came to India 3 weeks ago. And banaras was their last destination. They will be returning to germany tomorrow. We talked on many topics like tech, indian culture, divorce, foods, banaras, business. At last took photos with them and exchanged contacts. Felt nice talking to them. 




### # 24-Mar-2023 Friday
Woke up at 9am. That's some impressive progress. _dada_(grandfather) diagnosed with _Osteoporosis_. Ahhhhhh sad. Doctor prescribed daily & weekly medicines and treatment will take 3 years and for temproary pain relief gave _diclofenac_ injection. Old age is filled with so many problems. I am happy that _dada_ is with me and I am doing something for him. Not everyone gets this opportunity. Checked the BARC website. Downloaded the gate scorecard. Edited my linkedin profile and sent some connection requests. Talked to _lavish_ about colleges.  
Yesterday _pradeep_ recommended _scrcpy_ tool for screen mirroring. What an awesome piece of software it is. Just does what is says with tons of features. Single command and the phone's screen is available on the laptop in interactive mode. In starting I tested with usb cable, but now I am using it on wifi network. Replied to whatsapp's messages. Scrolled instagram. Atleast now I am able to use my phone. I can see my messages and otp's.  
Instagram is filled with useless people. Everyone is posting their adventurous trip photos. Some are going to national parks, some to goa, some to hill stations, some come to banaras. I don't have problem with trips. Trips and having fun with friends is good as they help in having good mental health. Neither do I have problem with people posting these photos on ig. The main problem is these newly employeed kids don't know the value of investing money. They are spending so much money in these trips. On hotels, on cool dresses, on nice foods, .... Sick people. These people will understand it later. These people are very very useless. On friday night, half of my ig stories is filled with their stories showing how low level mindset they have. A boy will be dancing on dance floor and the caption will be "Ab corporate naukar 2 din ki chhutti enjoy karega"(Now corporate servant will enjoy 2 days leave). What is this man? Dumb people.  
Also, now the country is divided into two parts. Girls like koreans and boys like russians. These big ig account people and ig memers have made russian word so slang. I hate it. Shame on these people. They are not understanding its consequences. India is viewed as a country that has values and culture. The world knows that Indians respect everyone. But when the whole world and specially russia will come to know that russian is slang word in India. What will they think of us then? Such a derogatory slang it is. It will destroy India's respectful image. These ig people are making fun and gaining followers and likes but they don't know its result. IG is cringe app filled with cringe people.




### # 23-Mar-2023 Thursday
Took _dada_(grandfather) to hospital. Talked to _pradeep_ about the phone screen mirroring software and also discussed about the colleges. Went to _assi ghat_ with _prateek_ at night. Had fun. Its 1am, and I am going to sleep to fix my fucked up routine.  
Headache is almost gone. Sometimes its there, but its very mild. Finally I am happy. Happy-happy.  
I love these lines from the song _Tum Tak_ (_Raanjhanaa_)-  
_nainon ke ghat le jaa, nainon kee naiya_  
_patavaar too hai meri, too khivaiyaa_  
_jaanaa hai paar tere, too hee bhanvar hai_  
_pahunchegi paar kaise najuk see naiya?_ 




### # 22-Mar-2023 Wednesday
Went to sleep at 1pm. Woke up at 5pm. Fuck. What is this man? I will become sick if I don't correct my sleep schedule. Phone has almost become unusable. Only the top section where it shows time and network is visible, and rest of the display becomes blank. I am thinking of mirroring the phone screen to laptop using the usb cable. For the same called _pradeep_ but he didn't picked the call. Wrote blog about how to install arch linux.  
Completed the _Farzi_ webseries. It was average for me. Sexual content was negligible. Perfect. Too much abusive language. Not at all perfect. Why does webseries use so much abusive language? Also, I was hoping of some more _kaabiliyat_(intelligence) by the lead actor. I don't understand why the person who works hard gets divorced. Didn't the wife already knew that the husband would not be able to give time. Then why did she marry him. Just to give divorce? This is not correct. Why marry someone who is dedicated to his work and would not be able to give time? If you already know the situation and want to marry, then why give divorce? Just don't marry him, as simple as that. Am I waiting for season 2? No. Will I watch season 2? No. Why? Because, it was not of my type.  
When I was out at night, I saw someone falling from his bike. Went to him. He was badly drunk. Then I and one more person went to drop the drunk uncle to his house 2km away. Should have I left him there thinking that someone will come and help him? _maa_(mother) keeps telling me not to get into these situations. She tells me that helping everytime is not good because the society is bad. But I don't understand all this. The goodness inside me is alive. Maybe someday I will get in trouble by helping someone, then I will understand.  
Politics in my family is growing. _maa_ is saying not to get into all this and focus on studies and job. But I think, I have to do something. They are playing their moves, and I am not doing anything because I really don't want to indulge in all these things. Lets see what happens.



### # 21-Mar-2023 Tuesday
Took the phone backup. Used phone for just 10-15 mins today because I can't even read text messages properly due to flickring screen. Again got wet in rain at night. Ahhhh, why it rains only when I go outside.  
Wiped _awesomewm_ and installed _bspwm_ on laptop. Happy. Now, I will document everything so that next time it will be easy for me. Also, I will upload the dot files to github.  
Downloaded _Farzi_ webseries and watched 3 episodes. I have just watched 1 series in past 3 years and it was _Scam 1992_. I usually don't watch movies and series. I don't like their stories. I have watched _Mirzapur_ part one, _Family Man_ part one, but have not watched part two. Why? Because, its not my type.  
I have to setup my laptop quickly so that I can resume my work. Waking up all night is not good for me, because the urge to watch pornographic content are at its peak. I have to put lot of energy to control myself. I don't want to watch porn. Porn is for loosers. And I am not one of them.



### # 20-Mar-2023 Monday
Went to _realme_ service centre. The phone is completely damaged. It will cost around 14,000 INR (display+motherboard+camera). Haahaahaa ha ha. Funny, because I can buy new phone in this much money. Its still in working condition, but the display is flickering and touch is also not working correctly. He told to backup data, because it can be dead anytime. I have to backup data asap then I will insert sim card and connect to wifi/data. Aahhhhhhhh, a small mistake costed me this much. Sad.  
Installed _bspwm_ on desktop. Yesterday on laptop, I think I was doing something wrong with _sxhkd_. Finally happy today.  
Went to _assi ghat_ with _prateek_ at night. The weather was cold. Enjoyed for 2 hours. Returned at 11pm.  
Some observations: There is always a tradeoff between time and money in real life. You can go with train and save money but waste time OR you can go with flight and spend money but save time. You can go to govt. hospitals and stand in queue and waste time but save money OR you can go to private hospitals and save time but spend money. (Today) I wasted 4 hours in _realme_ service centre just to come to conclusion that I don't want to do any upgrades because its costly OR I could just have bought new phone and save time but spend money.


### # 19-Mar-2023 Sunday
Total time waste today. Installed _bspwm_. Was happy. After reboot, it got stuck after the disk block check step. Wasted 7 hours to fix it. But no result. Finally at night clean wiped to _awesomewm_. I wasted whole day in this, but got to learn many new things. Now I have to install all the packages. And configure them individually. Ohhhhhhh, lot of work to do. This time I will write all the process in blogs and script some of them, so that next time I don't waste this much time. _mama_ came in evening to see _dada_. Made coffee for him. He loves coffee made by me. Took feedbacks from friends about the type of content I should **not** post on ig.  
At night I was driving scooty , suddenly it started raining. I got wet. No problem. Hailstones were also falling. They were hitting me on my face, head and hands very hard. No problem. But, I had phone in my pocket. I should have kept it inside scooty. It got wet and now the display is damaged. Sad. I have to take it to service centre tomorrow. Displays are too costly. Sad.  
I had bookmarked more than 800 websites in _firefox_ on laptop. I had to clean wipe to install _awesomewm_ and sadly could not backup the bookmarks. I have taken the backup of _/boot_ and _/home_. Now, I have to search where the _firefox_ kept the bookmarks. I have to restore it somehow.   






### # 18-Mar-2023 Saturday
Fasting _(Papamochani Ekadashi)_. Talked to _nii_ about colleges. _DTU_ seems to be good option, lets see what i get. First rain of the year. Got wet too, intentionally. Took scooty, went on small ride in _dlw_ and listening to _radha kripa kataksh_ and soft rain drops falling on me. Happy-happy.  
Hare Krishna.


### # 17-Mar-2023 Friday
Searched about colleges based on my gate score. Went to meet _nana-nani_. _mama_ was also there. Discussed with them about the gate result. _nana_ gave blessings that I will get admission in college. I also hugged _nana_. It was amazing. I don't remember when I hugged him last time. Very happy. Even in his old age, _nana_ is so cool.  
_pradeep_ said about me that "My experience with relationships has made me more strong. I am not able to see it, but after 3-4 years I will be more stronger than rest of the emotional peoples and be thankful that all these relationship bullshits happened with me." He told me to remember this. I am writing it here as a proof for the future me. Chatted with _rohit_ bhaiya of _IPEC Mess_ on ig. Felt good-good.






### # 16-Mar-2023 Thursday
Brought _dada_ to _dlw_ in morning. Slept for 2 hours in afternoon. Listened to _Vol 1_ by _Honey Singh_ in loop. This is not good. Listening to such derogatory songs once or twice for fun is okish but listening in loop is not at all good. It will destroy my taste for good songs. Also, it will pollute my subconscious mind slowly-slowly. Gate website got crashed due to heavy traffic. So instead of 4pm, the result came out around 10pm. Went to buy injection for _dada_ (_Deca-Durabolin_). Night walk with _prateek_ at _surya sarovar_. Saw gate result infront of him.  
Hmmmm, the result was neither good nor bad. It was what I deserved. But, after droping a year for preparation and the result comes out approx same as last year, sad. Was she responsible for all this? No. It was me who wasted my time, it was me who took the headache. How can someone waste my time, if i don't want. I am accountable for all this. Was time waste the only reason for my poor result? No. Split of energy in various directions, is my biggest problem. Whenever I prepare for something, I am not focused. I start doing things that are not so imp and could be done later. But my naughty mind. Ahhhhhh. I know what I am. I know how different I am form the rest of the crowd. I know my potential. The only thing required is focus. I have to concentrate on one thing. Spliting of time and brain power in many directions is not good. Lesson learnt: be happy yourself, don't give time and energy to anyone, and focus on only one thing.  
The _monika bansal_ meme I made yesterday got some good views because of the shares it got. That means I have to create something that is relatable so that people share them. _pankaj_ unfollowed me and _pradeep_ both. Hahahaaahhaa ha ha. Funny. People don't know why I came to ig. They think that I came to ig like everyone comes, to follow and follow back and waste tons of time. But I have purpose.    





### # 15-Mar-2023 Wednesday
Woke up at 3pm. Made 4 memes back to back. Got mixed reactions. My fav. was love marriage to arrange marriage meme, because it took some real effort in making it. Went to meet _choti maa_, had discussion about _dada-dadi_. Played with _syncthing_ setting. Backed up some files using it. Looked at Imagemagick documentation, its vast. Gate result will be declared tomorrow. Also, to fix my sleeping schedule, I will not sleep today. 


### # 14-Mar-2023 Tuesday
_nana-nani and mami_ came to meet us. Had fun with them. Got to learn many things from their experiences. Sent the blog link to my friends. Again _pradeep_ was asking about whats the use of this blinking effect. How to explain him, I don't know. Not everything is done for the purpose of use. I did it because I found it interesting. And after making it I was happy-happy. _Bajpai_ appreciated it. Had chit-chat with her. On some of her messages I reacted with heart emoji. She might think that I am simping. But I didn't. I generally don't react on messages, but lately using ig I have started reacting to messages and reels sent by heart emoji. And the same habbit reciprocated to whatsapp.  
Finally installed _syncthing_ on my phone and laptop. I have to test its various settings to decide which one suits my use case. Then I will delete google photos. Fuck google.   



### # 13-Mar-2023 Monday
Went to _samneghat_ to buy medicines. Wifi connection problem solved. Wrote blog about the flashing effect that I created 2 days ago. Created short tutorials about the telegram hacks and posted it on ig. Nobody responded, as usual. IG is cringe because it has cringe audience. Most of the people who use ig are dumb.  
Mental health is improving slowly-slowly. Headache is minimal. I am not getting time for meditation and exercise. My sleeping schedule is disturbed. Going to sleep at 6am and then waking up at 12 noon is not good. Sometimes I get scolded also. I need to fix this asap.



### # 12-Mar-2023 Sunday
Woke up in noon. Sleep cycle is pretty much fucked for sure. Went to meet dada-dadi (grandparents), as usual had verbal fight for the same old reason. I don't understand why they are doing like this. Their stubbornness will only harm them, and not the rest of the family. This is great learning for me. I don't know what I will do in my old age, but definitely sure that what my grandparents are doing, I will not do it.  
Asked my friends about the blinking gif I created yesterday, got most of the votes for 50fps, 1 for 18fps and 1 for 24fps. Personally, my vote goes for 24fps, because this is the sprit with which I created the gif. Also, the 50fps gif is slow blinking due to the fact that people are unable to comprehend it. So, its appearing as slow-slow.


### # 11-Mar-2023 Saturday
I have started procrastinating a lot. Thats not good. Created two memes. One was normal, about CTC vs inhand. And the other was about BTS. But people reacted 6 times more on low effort meme about CTC in comparision to BTS meme. Was my BTS meme so normiee?? I made it for fun, and not to hurt someone. Also, the meme was not so dark. I'm confused now. To grow in marketing and advertisement field, I need to know how people respond. I have to create more content to know how people react.  
Made blinking effect with the help of imagemagick and ffmpeg. Felt happy-happy, because it was something new I did and its rare in todays society what I did.  
Also, headache is subduing. But when it comes from time to time, its unbearable. Krishna, please help. You are _Sarva karanah karanam_. I know whats happening with me has some hidden cause. You and only you know the cause. Whatever you do is correct without any doubt. But krishna, please take away my headache. Please make me old nikhil, that used to be full of humour and joy and didn't have any headache. Please krishna.  
Hare Krishna.




### # 10-Mar-2023 Friday
Met many people today. Cousin and _mami_ in the afternoon, neighbours in the evening, _bua_(paternal aunt) and _prateek_ at night. Had discussion about feminism with neighbours. Also talked about jobs in tech industry with them. At night went to _Bhullanpur Station_ with _prateek_.  
Bugs did face revel on yt today. What a fucking video to watch this morning, it was looking like he has RGB lighting system inside his body. Haa haa haahahahah. I know it was ffmpeg magic. He probably did this by constantly changing the colors by selecting some specific color from the present frame.




### # 09-Mar-2023 Thursday
Lost days of nofap streak this morning. Sigh!! Lets make new nofap streak. This time I am more stronger. Added some notes to my website. Talked to _lavish_ about gate counselling. Talked to _pradeep_ about the same. But the talk went 2 hours long. Had some good discussion with him. _Patel_ called to inform me that venus and jupiter are clearly visible. Went outside to watch, _Patel_ was on the call. Happy to see the Venus aka the evening star, but sadly the jupiter was not visible. Switched to video call to show _Patel_ how the Venus looked from my POV. Being a girl(and that's important here), she accepted the video call without any second thought. Walking back home, I was on video call with her. Had some 5-6 minutes talk. Then she told me to talk to her mother on video call. I felt shy, so told her not to do so. But alas!! Her mother was on video call and we excahged greetings. Then _Patel_ showed me _aalu sabji_ her mother was making. Watched some videos about Obsidian. I will be switching to Obsidian for notes making and managing my tasks.  
In this busy society, showing you care for someone can be a challenging task. I am completely aware of the fact that nowadays people are busy, they don't have time for anyone. But but but, who the fuck wants to eat someone's time. What people want is closeness. A small act can show the care and closeness between two people. This act can vary from time to time and person to person. By saying that "I am busy, I don't have time,...." is not the solution. A small, very very small act of yours can make someones day. Mind that this small act doesnot take much of your time. But in this cruel and fake world, people are good with scrolling ig rather than doing some small act that hardly take 1-2 minutes to make someones day.  
Ahhhhhh!!! We are living in a world filled with fake and fraud people. Sad.




### # 08-Mar-2023 Wednesday
Played holi with neighbours after 8-9 years. Enjoyed a lot and ate delicious foods. Made changes to Linkedin profile. Had quality discussion with _mama_ (maternal uncle) on "the right age for girls to get married?". I totally agree with him that the right age for girls to get married is 26-28. But due to some internal reasons that I can't mention here, I was inclined towards 30-31 years is the right age for girls to get married. Whatever points _mama_ told to support his thought, I completely agree with him.  
I also know that today's generation will not understand all this. They all are of the mentality that, "This is my life, I will do things what I like and when I like". But they are wrong. They are unaware of the asramas mentioned in our scriptures. The four asramas are: Brahmacharya (student), Gṛhastha (householder), Vanaprastha (forest walker/forest dweller), and Sannyasa (renunciate). The Asrama system is one facet of the Dharma concept in Hinduism. And to fully enjoy the life, it has to be equally divided into these asramas. If todays generation gets married in their 30's, then how will they manage the rest of the life i.e. Gṛhastha, Vanaprastha and Sannyasa. If a person is getting married in his/her 30's, then his/her life should be of atleast 120-130 years to actually enjoy the life.  
Had fun with cousins. _nii_ and I listened to _Altaf Raja_ songs (Aawara Hawa Ka Jhonka Hoon, Tum To Thehre Pardesi). Went to drop her to station at night. Came back home and messaged some of my friends _Happy Holi_, including _Bajpai_. It was just 5-10 minutes left to 12 midnight. Hahahaaaa ha ha. Funny. Btw, I was busy whole day, so didn't get time to message anyone.  
This _Holi_ was special for many reasons. **Bugs** showed his face. He uploaded a video on ig doing face reveal. When I saw, I started shouting and couldn't believe what just happened. I cann't express what was going inside my mind and body. You start watching some youtuber with just 1k-2k subscribers. Slowly you start falling in love with the youtuber. He makes you addicted to his videos. Everyday you check youtube to check whether he uploaded some video or not. And after 3 years, you get to see his face. Ohhhhhh. What a moment!! I started watching him from 2021. He didn't teach me all the linux stuff that I know right now. The credit of my linux knowledge goes to many people around the world. What **Bugs** did is, he inspired me to pursue linux instead of so many problems. He put fire in me for the free and open source softwares. He inspired me to have personal website. To have personal mail. He showed me the cool world of linux. He is my man. Thanks _bugs_. 





### # 07-Mar-2023 Tuesday
Went to meet _dada-dadi_ (grandparents). Played chess with _nii_. Watched some iit dance videos with her. Discussed about counselling procedure. Went to see moon, jupiter and venus on recommendation of _Patel_. But no luck. On east side moon was there. But on west side, no shiny object found. Maybe my timing was wrong. Applied for BARC exam. Felt good-good because of less headache.  



### # 06-Mar-2023 Monday
Had fun with _nii_. Discussed many things. Watched dance videos together. And some funny ones too. Also showed her some cool linux scripts that I wrote. Went to meet relatives. We four played mini militia too. Obviously, I won. Commented on _Bajpai's_ ig post. Headache is persistent. I am thinking of starting meditaion and running in morning to release some good hormones. It might help in fixing my headache. Or might not? Lets see.



### # 05-Mar-2023 Sunday
Learnt about imagemagick commands. Wrote a script to remove exif data and then to annonate the custom date and place in the image using convert. Soon will be publishing it on my blog and github. Went to assi with _prateek_. Clicked some photos, will be posting it on my personal gallery. Headache was there. I don't know when my situation will improve.  
Btw, this same day of the last month, I called her to get the worst news. She said she doesn't have feelings anymore and wants breakup. The exact line were - _Ab wo baat nahi rahi. Ab feelings nahi rahi_. I was shocked.  
Then I contacted her close friend _Kumari_ (she was her roommate in the infosys training center mysore and also her 4 year college friend), and told her the situation. Then _Kumari_ said that, she(my ex) got very close to a boy named _Shiva Hosamani_. They used to have everything together. Having breakfast, lunch, dinner. Going to malls, waching movies. Playing games, cycling. Everything they used to do together. _Kumari_ told me that she was her roommate just for sleeping at night, rest of the time she was with _Shiva Hosamani_. _Kumari_ also said that people in the infosys training campus started questioning them, _"Is there something between you both?"_. Even _Kumari_ asked her about her relationship with _Shiva Hosamani_ and what about your relationship with _nikhil_?  
But no, she played very well. She didn't tell anyone. She kept it secret. When I called her on this day of the last month, then she tells me that she doesn't have feelings for me anymore. Hahahahahaaahaaa haaahaaahaa. So funny. When you do everything with a male person(_Shiva Hosamani_), eating, drinking, playing, studing, watching movies, bicycling, and many more things, then you  tell me that you don't have feelings for me anymore. Good game _Yadav_, good game. She used to tell me I am shatir (clever). But it turns out that she is more shatir (clever) than me.  
One of the reasons why Long Distance Relationships don't work is loyalty. People cheat in LDR. I don't know from where she learnt all this. Was this type of teaching given by her family, Or was it her close friends, who taught her all this? Even in my dreams, I never thought that she would cheat on me. But now its reality. Even her friends _Kumari_ and _Srivastava_ are like her. Are all girls like this? Is being loyal so hard in present time?  
Its life long lesson for me. One of the worst feeling is _being used as an object_. She used me. But I never used her. Never. But no problem. **Karma** is there, it will take care of everything. No one can escape Karma. And she has to pay very heavy price for what she has done. Using someone when required, and then throwing him because no use now. Its wrong. Torturing someone like this, pushing him in the deep well of depression. Its wrong. Karma will punish her. Not only her, but me too. Maybe whats happening with me is result of my bad Karma. Maybe..... 


### # 04-Mar-2023 Saturday
Less headache than yesterday, yupp its krishna's mercy. Had the plan of going to assi with _prateek_. But cancelled it and went to night walk nearby with him. Made idm vs aria2c meme and uploaded to reddit. The day went well. In evening headache started, and esclated slowly slowly. At night it was at its peak. Had discussion about her with _pradeep_. Told him that this is the last discussion we are having about her. I don't want any more bullshits. I don't want to talk about liers and fake people.  
I have come to realisation that, whatever happened cann't be reversed. So accept it and move on. People in this world are way too selfish. She used me. Used me for everything. And I helped her in every possible way. Now, she got someone else, so she dumped me. I was use and throw for her. Basically, I was object for her. I gave 110% of my time and energy and she didn't put any effort. And now she is blaming me for making the relationship toxic. And she played fake love so well that I didn't get any hint. She faked it for using me. She wasted my precious 1 year. Ahhhhhh cruel world!!!  
What I learnt from all this - there is no place for good people in this fake world. So, _maa chudhaye sab, humko kya_ (Let everyone get their mothers fucked, I don't care anymore). Be happy yourself. Don't care for anyone, they have got their own hands, legs, eyes, brain,... They can take care of themself. You focus on your goal. 




### # 03-Mar-2023 Friday
Today it was _Amalaki Ekadashi_. So I was on fast as usual.  
I am in deep deep depression. I don't know how much time it will take for me to recover from this pain. There is nobody with whom I can share my sadness. No one will understand me. Constant headache, all day all night. Sometimes I feel like banging my head in wall. And other times I feel like cutting my skull and putting some ice inside, then stiching the skull back.  
Also I redesigned my website. Earlier I was using _gruvhugo_ theme but now it's _charlolamode_ theme. I am doing all this to keep myself busy. I don't want to remember her anymore. She has done very bad with me. Nobody in this world has the right to play with someone for fun. I repeat, nobody. Who has given you the right to play with someone's emotions.  
I hope I don't take any wrong steps. Krishna, please help me. This world is filled with cruel, fake and fraud people. And I don't want to live with them. Please give me strength Krishna.  
Hare krishna hare krishna, krishna krishna hare hare.  
Hare rama hare rama, rama rama hare hare.
