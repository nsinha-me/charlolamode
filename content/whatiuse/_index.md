## My Laptop

I love my laptop. It's my first laptop. This machine has been with me through thick and thin. It has almost never let me down. I mean everyone messes up once or twice. This laptop is what a smartphone is to most people of my age.

Booting it with Linux was the best gift I have given to my laptop. Now we three (I, my laptop and Linux), live in total harmony. We take care of each other. We support each others in our hard times. There are many ups and downs to come in our lives, but none of them can break the bond that has developed between us.
